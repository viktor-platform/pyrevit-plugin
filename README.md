## Contribute
Feel free to re-use and/or improve this plugin for your own projects. Below are some useful things to know, should you want to add more functionality.

### Structure

Note that the structure of the repo and the corresponding filenaming system directly affects the layout of how the tab, panel and buttons are defined
in the VIKTOR addin tab.

```
.
â””â”€â”€ VIKTORPlugin.extension/
    â”œâ”€â”€ VIKTOR.tab/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ some_group.panel/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ some_action.pushbutton
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ some_link.urlbutton
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ another_group.panel/
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ another_action.pushbutton
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ another_link.urlbutton
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ lib/  # globally available package (in this extension) that can be imported in all panels/button scripts
        â””â”€â”€ viktor/  # nested so that in a script you can use `from viktor import api`
            â”œâ”€â”€ api
            â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Example cases

Note that during our last UCODE Hackathon, one of the attending groups has taken this `pyrevit-plugin` code and used and updated it to fit their particular use-case.
Please have a look at their repository, to get an idea of how you can expand this **prototype**:  **[revitcentral](https://github.com/SvenDeLeau/revitcentral)**
